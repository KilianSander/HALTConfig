parameter;label;description
mode;Mode;"Select ""a priori"" for configuration, ""post-hoc"" for post-hoc prevalence calculation."
device;Target Device;"Select ""headphones"" or ""loudspeakers"" as the target playback device."
parparticipants;Participants;Enter the minimum number of required participants with the target device who passed the screening test.
base_rate;Baserate/Prevalence;Enter the estimated percentage of headphone users in your target population.
scc;SCC;"Select ""yes"" if you want to use the ""Split Convince Compare"" method (SCC)."
change_rate;Change Rate;Enter the estimated percentage of non-target playback device users who will switch to the target device after reguest.
min_prob;Minimum Probability;Enter the probability that the required participants who passed the screening test used the target playback device (range from 0.6 to 1.0).
tolerance;Tolerance;A value of 0 searches for the screening procedures with the minimum sample size. If set to a value > 0 the function returns the screening procedures whose sample sizes exceed the minimum sample size by at most this value.
lr_disc;Left-Right Discrimination;"Select ""EX"" if participants that have difficulties with left-right-discrimination (recommended) should be excluded immediately. Select ""SAVE"" if the obtained information should only be saved."
mono_inter;Mono/Interchanged CH;"Select ""EX"" if participants with mono playback or interchanged stereo channels should be excluded immediately. Select ""SAVE"" if the obtained information should only be saved."
screening;Screening Behavior;"Select ""EX"" if participants with a screening result that indicates the usage of the non-target playback device should be excluded immediately. Select ""SAVE"" if the screening result should only be saved."
max_loops;Loop Threshold;Enter the maximum number of allowed incorrect responses for the loop task (playback level setting) after which the participants will be excluded.
volume_level;Volume Level;"Select ""-8.4 LUFS"" for highly compressed stimuli with low dynamic range. Select ""-20 LUFS"" for stimuli with normal to high dynamic range. You have to adjust your stimuli to the selected LUFS value (integrated). If you have clipping problems after adjusting your stimuli to -8.4 LUFS the dynamic range of your stimuli is not low enough. In this case you should select -20 LUFS and adjust your stimuli to -20 LUFS."
