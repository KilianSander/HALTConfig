parameter;label;description
volume_level;Volume Level;"Select ""-8.4 LUFS"" for highly compressed stimuli with low dynamic range. Select ""-20 LUFS"" for stimuli with normal to high dynamic range. You have to adjust your stimuli to the selected LUFS value (integrated). If you have clipping problems after adjusting your stimuli to -8.4 LUFS the dynamic range of your stimuli is not low enough. In this case you should select -20 LUFS and adjust your stimuli to -20 LUFS."
max_loops;Loop Threshold;Enter the maximum number of allowed incorrect responses for the loop task (playback level setting) after which the participants will be excluded.
channel_check;Use channel check;"Whether to include the tasks to check the channels. If screening tests are used channels will be checked."
lr_disc;Left-Right Discrimination;"Select ""EX"" if participants that have difficulties with left-right-discrimination (recommended) should be excluded immediately. Select ""SAVE"" if the obtained information should only be saved."
mono_inter;Mono/Interchanged CH;"Select ""EX"" if participants with mono playback or interchanged stereo channels should be excluded immediately. Select ""SAVE"" if the obtained information should only be saved."
frequency_check;Use frequency check;Whether to include the tasks to estimate the lower frequency limit of the playback device.
screening_parts;Use screening parts;Whether to include the headphone screening tasks and the channel check.
base_rate;Baserate/Prevalence;Enter the estimated percentage of headphone users in your target population.
conf_auto;Screening configuration based on;"You can configure the screening tests in three different ways.""prevalence and overall utility"" displays all possible test combinations with their overall utility. The ""best"" test (combination) is the one with the highest overall utility among several tests for the application. ""sample size estimations"" is an a priori estimation of the sample size based on the required number of participants with the target device who passed the screening test and the minimum probability for that event. ""manual threshold specification"" allows you to set up screening tests as you like, which is a kind of expert mode."
device;Target Device;"Select ""headphones"" or ""loudspeakers"" as the target playback device."
parparticipants;Participants;"Only relevant for ""Screening configuration based on sample size estimations"". Enter the minimum number of required participants with the target device who passed the screening test."
min_prob;Minimum Probability;"Only relevant for ""Screening configuration based on sample size estimations"". Enter the probability that the required participants who passed the screening test used the target playback device (range from 0.6 to 1.0)."
screening;Screening Behavior;"Select ""EX"" if participants with a screening result that indicates the usage of the non-target playback device should be excluded immediately. Select ""SAVE"" if the screening result should only be saved."
